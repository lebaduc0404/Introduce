          Nutrify is powered by a computer vision model capable of identifying
          420 foods (for now, more coming soon).
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Simply point your phone at food and take a photo, Nutrify will do its
          best to identify what‚Äôs in it and show relevant information.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          All image processing happens on-device using the Neural Engine, so
          predictions happen really fast and work offline.

          Nutrify's computer vision models run on-device and leverage the Neural
          Engine (Apple's chip for machine learning) so they happen fast and
          work without an internet connection (even on the top of a mountain).
          The video is a live screen recording of a lasagne lunch hike break on
          top of Mt. Tamborine, Queensland, Australia.

          üìî Create a Visual Food Diary
        </h3>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          When you take a photo with Nutrify, you have the option to save or
          delete it.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Saving it stores it in your Visual Food Diary, an excellent way to
          reflect on what you‚Äôve eaten.

          Don't count calories. Look at what you've eaten instead. Nutrify
          enables an easy way to keep a visual log of what you've eaten.
          Something to reflect on or show a healthcare practitioner.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          In my experience with keeping food diaries, I‚Äôve found that numbers on
          a page (calorie counting) are too specific for me.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Instead, I much prefer seeing what I‚Äôve eaten (ideally, a wide range
          of whole foods).
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          You could use this to show a nutrition coach or wellness practitioner
          what you‚Äôve eaten and get their insights.
