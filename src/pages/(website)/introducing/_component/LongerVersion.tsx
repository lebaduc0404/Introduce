          The app my brother and I have been dreaming about for years.

          The initial goals I wrote in 2017 when I started learning AI and
          machine learning with my self-created AI Masters Degree.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Nutrify is the nutrition part of that goal.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          It’s designed to be an easy and fun way to learn about whole foods.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">I say whole foods on purpose.</p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Because Nutrify focuses on foods you could forage for or farm or make
          in your kitchen.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          As in, foods without barcodes or packaging.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          If Nutrify has one central dogma, it’s that.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          We believe whole foods are healthier than ultra-processed foods.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          When I studied nutrition and food science at university, that was the
          central point.

            Standard American Diet
          </a>{" "}
          (SAD for short, funny), a diet full of ultra-processed foods, is a
          good alternative (AKA diets full of whole foods).

        <p className="mt-[2px] text-center mb-[5px] block italic">
          The Standard American Diet (SAD for short). If I learned anything in a
          nutrition and food science degree it's that nutrition can be summed up
          by avoiding foods like this. And that most of food science is
          dedicated to making foods like this.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          There were also many fun and interesting things I’d learn about food
          but seem to forget whenever I actually wanted to remember them.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          In other words, I’d remember the information for passing exams but not
          when I was looking at food or eating it.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          When I learned about computer vision I had the idea of bringing this
          knowledge to the food.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          As in, use the camera as the intelligence layer.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">This is of course, not new.</p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Computer vision has been used for many different use cases. Even for
          identifying foods in other apps.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Nutrify’s differentiating factor is that it focuses on food categories
          and discovery rather than counting calories.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Because if you’re eating whole foods, moving often and sleeping well,
          you don’t need to count calories.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          To keep it simple, I love food and I love machine learning.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
          Nutrify is the love child of these two passions.
