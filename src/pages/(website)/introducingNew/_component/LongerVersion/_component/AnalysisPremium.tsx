        Calorie and Macronutrient Breakdowns (Premium)
      </h3>
      <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
        Nutrify Premium members can also now get a breakdown of your calorie and
        macronutrient intake per food in the new Calories and Macros views.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
        This is a great way to see what foods contribute to what macronutrient
        levels.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
        And similarly, how many calories are in a given serving of food.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
        When you identify a food with the Nutrify camera, its default weight is
        set to 1 serving of that food.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
        For example, the default weight for a red apple is 182g.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
        And the default weight for a rice cake is 9g (one rice cake).
      </p>
      <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] block">
        These can be easily adjusted in the food view.
